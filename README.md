# SIH-2022

We developed this innovative AR application to cultivate tourism in our country. The app, Mono Meta, is an augmented reality experience that superimposes virtual objects onto the real world. It's like a pokemon go for history buffs and tourists! Through the app, users can learn about the cultural significance of certain landmarks and locations. For example, they can place a virtual object at the site of an ancient battle and see what it would have looked like. Or they can view a 3D reconstruction of a famous building that no longer exists. Mono Meta is a fun and educational way to explore our country's history and culture!
